# JavaScript class-based inheritance 
The objective of this repo is to test the actual scale of object oriented programming capabilities in JavaScript  `ES6` / `ECM6` compared to high level object oriented programming language.
Example contains a base class <b>Person</b> and two sub classes <b>Teacher</b> and <b>Student</b> which extend the base class.

## What is class diagram in OOP?
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects them selves.

## Example
 ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Implement the following diagram using inheritance in JS OOP approach in ECMA6

- This is an example to see how the inheritance in JS OOP works + implementing actual diagram.
